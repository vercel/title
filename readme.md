# title

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/zeit/title.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This package correctly capitalizes your titles as per [The Chicago Manual of Style](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html). Furthermore, all of
ZEIT's product names are capitalized properly as well.

## Usage

Firstly, install the package:

```bash
yarn add title
```

Then load it and convert any input:

```js
const title = require('title')

title('noW deSktop and now cLI are prODUCts of zeIt')

// Will result in:
// "Now Desktop and Now CLI Are Products of ZEIT"
```

You can even pass words that should be capitalized as specified:

```js
title('FaCEbook is great', {
  special: [ 'facebook' ]
})

// Will result in:
// "facebook is great"
```

That's it!

### Command Line

You can also convert titles in the command line, if you want. Install the package globally:

```bash
yarn global add title
```

Next, run it:

```bash
title "noW deSktop and now cLI are prODUCts of zeIt"

# Will result in:
# "Now Desktop and Now CLI Are Products of ZEIT"
```

To see all available options, run:

```bash
title -h
```
